# The Project in general
## The naming
The name of our project, "Shifa" is chosen to pay homage to the Shifa Hospital located in the Gaza Strip. This hospital has been a critical medical facility in the region, providing essential healthcare services to the community. Unfortunately, it has faced significant challenges, including damage from recent Isr**li bombardments. By naming our project "Shifa," we aim to honor the resilience and importance of institutions like the Shifa Hospital and raise awareness about the humanitarian situation in Gaza.

### Brief description

It is an "appointment management system in a hospital" made to simplify the process of taking appointments by patients and minimize time and distances for them, also made as a simple management system for the hospital where it provides some other features such as managing patients and staff (doctors and secretaries) accounts, managing health services, and the hospital capacities...
